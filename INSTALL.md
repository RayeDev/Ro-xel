# INSTALLATION GUIDE:
So you want to use Xel? but you don't know how everything works. Sadly, you have to Copy and Paste these due to them being used in a diffrent game and I don't want to leak code.

# START HERE!!
first, everything will be handled in [ReplicatedStorage](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ReplicatedStorage), Make a folder called "xel", after that, follow the "xel" folder in github and there you go. (BTW: ALL SCRIPTS ARE MODULE SCRIPTS!!!)

# HELP:
read the Wiki first!!
